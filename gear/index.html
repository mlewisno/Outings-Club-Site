<h2>Borrowing Gear from Us</h2>

<p>One of the services we provide is gear rental. Whether you&rsquo;re going to Findley
State Park for a single night or the Rockies for spring break, we can loan you
some of the gear you&rsquo;ll need. Membership is the only requirement, and there&rsquo;s
no cost to you, as long as you bring it back by the agreed-upon date.</p>

<p>Email us to reserve gear ahead of time, or just show up during <a href="../contact/index.html">office
hours</a>. (Those with large groups that need lots of gear
should definitely reserve ahead of time.) When you pick up the gear, you&rsquo;ll
fill out an electronic form detailing your use of the gear and agreeing to a
return date.  Please note that participants on open trips get preference for
gear rental.  This is almost never an issue, with the exception of fall and
spring breaks.</p>

<h2>Gear for Open Trips</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re participating in an open (OCOC-sponsored) trip, you may or may not
need to come borrow gear from us personally. In some cases, the trip leader(s)
will take a count of what gear is needed by the trip&rsquo;s participants and bring
it themselves, but this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Consult your trip leader to be
sure!</p>

<h2>The Rental Agreement</h2>

<p>Whether you'r going on your own adventures or participating in an
OCOC-sponsored trip, you&rsquo;ll have to agree to some basic terms and conditions
before you can borrow gear from us. Here they are for reference; you&rsquo;ll have
another chance to look them over when you fill out the form in the office:</p>

<blockquote><p>I, the undersigned, do hereby promise to adhere to the terms of the Oberlin
College Outings Club Equipment Rental Policy, as stated below. The renter
takes full responsibility for the equipment rented in his/her name from the
Oberlin College Outings Club. The Outings Club assumes no responsibility for
the gear or its performance, nor will the club be held liable for any
personal injury resulting from use, proper or improper, of the gear. The
renter will return the rented equipment to the Oberlin Outings Club Gear
Closet at the pre-appointed time (below).</p>

<p>Failure to return equipment on time will result in the following: 1st Week –
$5.00 fee per item 2nd Week – An additional $5.00 per item 3rd Week – Full
replacement costs will be charged to the renter’ s Oberlin College account,
and the renter’ s Outings Club Membership will be suspended for one full
semester, pending review by OCOC officers. The renter will return all
equipment in the same condition in which it was rented. If equipment is
returned damaged (i.e. broken mechanism, missing parts, ripped material), the
renter will be charged a repair cost, not less than $10.00 and not exceeding
the cost of replacement. In the case of lost or un-repairable equipment, the
full replacement cost will be charged to the renter’ s Oberlin College
account. The renter always has the option to pay any repair/replacement costs
outright and avoid having their account billed. The renter(s) will return all
equipment in a clean and dry condition.  If equipment is returned in less
than a clean and dry condition, a cleaning fee of $10.00 will be charged to
the renter’ s account. Cookware and utensils should be scrubbed clean with
soap.  All other equipment should be brushed and scrubbed clean, but not
laundered.  The renter agrees to commit no less than half an hour to the
equipment return process, which will take place with an Outings Club Officer.
This agreement and form will be approved by an Outings Club officer before
gear is dispensed to participants.</p></blockquote>
